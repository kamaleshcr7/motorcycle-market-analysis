🏍️ Exploratory Data Analysis and Business Insights on Bike Sales Using Python and MySQL
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data to identify performance trends, top-selling brands, and customer preferences.
Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and MySQL, I performed data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, and visualization to derive actionable business insights.

🎯 Objectives

Understand brand-wise, model-wise, and region-wise performance.

Identify key revenue drivers and seasonal sales patterns.

Analyze customer age group trends.

Explore correlations between engine capacity, mileage, and price.

Generate insights for better marketing and inventory decisions.
